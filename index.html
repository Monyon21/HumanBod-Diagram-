      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <p>
        BodyWise helps students and general learners explore human anatomy and learn healthy habits.
        It combines a clickable body diagram with a Teachable Machine image model that recognizes body parts
        via webcam (Head/Face, Arms/Hands, Legs/feet, Eye, Ears).
      </p>
      <h3>Problem it solves</h3>
      <p>
        Many learners memorize parts without connecting them to function and health. This app shows functions,
        common issues, and prevention tips — making health education practical and memorable.
